*TODO: updated README*

This archive contains imfit, a program for fitting arbitrary sets of 2D model
functions to astronomical images in FITS format. Also included is makeimage, a
program for generating model FITS images (using, for example, the output of
imfit).  See http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/ (and the documentation
file imfit_howto.pdf) for more information.

If you downloaded the binary-only version (e.g., imfit-x.x-macintel.tar.gz),
copy the executable files imfit and makeimage to someplace convenient on your
path. See docs/imfit_howto.pdf for detailed notes on how to use them.

If you downloaded the source-code archive (e.g., imfit-x.x-source.tar.gz), see
docs/imfit_howto.pdf for details on compiling imfit and makeimage. (As explained
there, you will also need to have, at a minimum, the Python-based SCons package
and the cfitsio and fftw3 libraries in order to compile the programs.)

Sample configuration files and images can be found in the examples/
subdirectory; see the README_examples.txt file there for details.
